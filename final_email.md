Dear George,

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback about your recent experience at our resort. I'm so sorry to hear that the weather didn't quite live up to your expectations. I love the idea of your song title, by the way!

Regarding the weather, April is usually a great time to visit Arizona, with mild temperatures and plenty of sunshine. However, it's not uncommon to have some cloudy days during this time of year.

I want to assure you that we value your feedback and would like to make things right. Could you please tell me more about your stay, such as the specific dates you visited and any other details that might be helpful for us to know?

Thank you again for your feedback, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Sarah, Resident Manager
